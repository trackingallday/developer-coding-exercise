# When 531 People Do Good
Of the 634 people who held an orange Lego brick in their hand yesterday, **531** of them cared enough to give it back.

Those 531 people made a conscious decision to make sure it got to the right place. They decided that making a quick detour to our [Canterbury Tech Summit](http://www.techsummit.nz/) booth was worth it.

This year, Summit-goers showed us we were right to put our faith in people. In the end, 84% of attendees decided to do the right thing.

For those who donâ€™t know, at the Tech Summit this year (just like last year), we opted out of swag bags, and opted in to giving.
